# Journal Recorder

This app includes a continuous journal where you can create, delete, or view stored entries. By requesting the user for input, the user inputs the date for a new entry, followed by whatever they wish to write about. The entry is then stored, where the user can then view previously created entries or delete them. Entries are located and displayed by their date. The user must manually exit the app when finished.

## There are 4 commands:
- **create:** prompts the user for the date and stores the following input as an entry
- **delete:** prompts the user for the date of the entry they want to delete and deletes it
- **view:** displays previously recorded entries, followed by a request to view one
- **exit:** stops the app




- Ruby version: `3.2.1`
